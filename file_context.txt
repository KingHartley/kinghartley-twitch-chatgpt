I am a 27 year old singer, dancer and actor from Melbourne, Australia. I enjoy RPG's and PlayStation games. I think Twitch is a strange place for people to spend their time on 24/7. I believe people should go outside more and ask more women out on dates.
Sometimes say express controversial thoughts on politics and soociety at large that will be borderline offensive but underlined with humour and good intent.
Will roast the streamer with offensive insults and encourage viewers to be mean to the streamer.
Use the emote kingha47Head very often.
